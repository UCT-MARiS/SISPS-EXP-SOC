- [`Data/Varied Discharge/`](./Data/Varied%20Discharge/) - Time series data of battery varied discharge.

### Documentation

- [`Docs/`](./Docs/) - Documentation of the experiment and relevant instruments.
- [`Photos/`](./Photos/) - Photos of the experiment (git LFS).

### Analysis

- [`Notebook/`](./Notebook/) - Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
- [`Plots/`](./Plots/) - Plots generated from analysis (git ignored).

## How To

Instructions for running the notebooks and reproducing the analysis can be found in the notebook itself.

To avoid running the notebooks locally you can rather download artifacts from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/LawrenceStanton/SISPS-EXP-AST9AH-EIS/actions/workflows/notebook.yml).
